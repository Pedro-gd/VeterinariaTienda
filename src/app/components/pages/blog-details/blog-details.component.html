                    commodo consequat. There’s an old maxim that states, “No fun for the writer, no fun for the
                    reader.”No matter what industry
                    you’re working in, as a blogger, you should live and die by this statement.</p>
                <p>I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born
                    and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
                    explorer of the
                    truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
                    because it is pleasure.</p>
